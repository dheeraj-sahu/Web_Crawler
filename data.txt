&#x27;switches&#x27; are turning handguns into machine guns ...
          
i guess it depends why they are shooting. is it to injure or kill as many people in an area, or shoot a particular individual at some considerable distance. i think the gp post is looking at from the perspective of the gun owner? even from their perspective it may not make sense to modify the weapon. obviously, not shooting at all and injuring anyone is the best, in general.

engineering sleep
          
for the afficionados, there&#x27;s an excellent paper titled &quot;the neurobiological basis of narcolepsy&quot; published in nature reviews neuroscience which examines the relationship between orexin and sleep as it relates to narcolepsy patients: 
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2f;articles&#x2f;pmc6492289&#x2f;
in narcolepsy type 1 (nt1), patients have severely diminished orexin levels. this appears to cause them to inappropriately enter rem sleep.
op notes that the mutation lowering the sleep requirement causes an increase in orexin. i wonder whether the increased orexin could be inhibiting rem and perhaps facilitating a more restful architecture of sleep. alternatively, perhaps elevated orexin levels during the day cause wakefulness such that you just don&#x27;t need as much sleep, regardless of how efficient the sleep is.
it would be interesting to compare sleep tracking data of people with and without this mutation to see if there are significant differences in time spent in different sleep stages.

a statistical approach to model evaluations
          
personal sad story, but hopefully relevant: during my recent phd i worked on a problem where i used a dirichlet process in my solution. that paper has been bouncing around for the past few years getting rejected from every venue i have submitted it to. my interpretation is that most reviewers (there are exceptions) don&#x27;t understand any non-dl theory anymore and are not willing to read up for the sake of a fair review. this is based on their comments, where we have been told that our solution is complex (maybe? - but no one suggests an alternative), exposition is not clear (we have rewritten the paper a few times - we rewrite it based on comments from venue i to submit to venue i+1 - its a wild goose chase), and in one case, someone said the paper is derivative because it uses blackwell-macqueen sampling; their evidence? - they skimmed through a paper we had cited that also used the sampling algorithm. this is like saying a paper is derivative because it uses sgd.
i am on the review panel of some conferences too and it is not uncommon to be assigned a paper outside of my comfort zone. that doesn&#x27;t mean i cut and bail. you set aside time, read up on the area, ask authors questions, and judge accordingly. unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t happen most of the time - people seem to be in a rush to finish their review no matter the quality. at this point, we just mechanically keep resubmitting the paper every once a while.
sorry, end of rant :)

you have direct evidence above that the book cover is 
not
 a superficial thing.  if you don&#x27;t take this into account, then you&#x27;re not a serious author.

sol-ark manufacturer reportedly disables all deye ...
          
not sure why sol-ark is getting blamed.
people were buying chinese inverters meant for the chinese market off aliexpress on the gray market and shipping them to other countries.  deye decided to crack down on the behavior.
there’s nothing indicating this has anything to do with sol-ark at this point other than them being the approved distributor of rebranded deye inverters in the us.

i love hardware mysteries.
i mostly drive old 90s enthusiast cars, and i have had my fair share of undocumented switches.
the most surprising to date was in a nissan silvia, from 1989. sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t crank off the key, given the solution chosen it must have been a wiring issue. instead of fixing that wiring, the previous owner had directly wired power to the starter via a &quot;missle switch&quot; style switch, and instead of mounting it anywhere remotely useful, it was just spliced into the loom and sat on top of the rocker cover in the engine bay.
so if it wouldn&#x27;t start, i had to leave the key at &quot;on&quot;, hop out of the car, bump that switch and then it would start. obviously standing in front of a manual car while starting it is the dumbest thing next to wiring your starter to a switch in the engine bay. fortunately i never ran myself over.

how the pyramids were built with ancient concrete
          
i would not agree that it&#x27;s the most plausible theory. it is a hypothesis but what this website is doing is selectively picking there observations to align with their already known conclusion. because when you start digging into all of this stuff, even from these people, you start to get into very fringe theories beyond just a geopolymer limestone. they talk about melting granite and giant lenses and traveling the world and repeating this over and over. some truly outlandish stuff.
the more outlandish your claims are the bigger the proof needs to be. the only evidence they provide is that geopolymers are a possibility but that has been a well-known thing for many decades. they are lacking a lot of evidence to show this is really how the pyramids and other ancient structures were made.

engineering sleep
          
why is it not a survival advantage? probably because we didn&#x27;t work 18 hour days, the extra wakeness would just be used for rest.
night shifts that anyone can do are still needed if you need tribal watchers, and normal 8hr sleeping people can wake upnand fight when needed.
in terms of the gene, i am suprised how rare it is (90 families?) given i have met someone who needs only 4hr sleep.
another point is less sleep doesn&#x27;t mean you can do 2 more hours work a day. that is another vector: how much work per day (physical, mental) can be done.

you can take as many bytes from the output stream as you want, and they should all be indistinguishable from random to someone who can&#x27;t guess the input. (similar to how each of the bytes of a sha-256 hash should appear independently random.) but for example in the catastrophic case where someone found a collision in the default 256-bit blake3 output, they would probably be able to construct colliding outputs of unlimited length with little additional effort.

create an online shop in 7 minutes – $45&#x2f;year, no ...
          
are you looking for a quick and affordable way to create an online shop? with pagepalooza, you can generate a website, add your domain, connect stripe, upload your products, and start selling — all in under 7 minutes.
this shop is designed for simplicity. you do not have a cart and you can only add products and not items or variations such as colors and sizes. you get a built in checkout page and a product detail page along with an order confirmation email to the buyer and an email for you when someone makes an order. all that is for $45&#x2f;year.
after generating a website from a single prompt and purchasing the ecommerce extension, you can start building your shop. you can also watch the 7 minute youtube video and follow the steps to launch your shop.
1. add products
you can add a “physical”, “digital” or a “service” type of products. when someone purchases any products they will get a confirmation email. if a “digital” product was purchased, the buyer also receives a downloadable link that you insert for the products when creating it.
2. add the “product cards” ecommerce section
when you are finished with adding your products, you will need to add the the ecommerce section to the website template. this will add a new section to your website that has the products displayed as cards.
3. connect your stripe account
in order for the purchasing part to function and for you to be able to get paid you will need a payment gateway. you will need to sign-up on stripe, fill in your business information and get the api keys.
4. start selling
after adding your domain, your products will be available for purchase and displayed on your website.
whenever the “buy now” button is clicked on a product the user will be directed to a built in checkout page to add their card information and shipping&#x2f;billing addresses.
pagepalooza is the quickest, effective and affordable way to create an online shop with no hidden fees and only a yearly payment of $45&#x2f;year. this simplified ecommerce system is ideal for a shop with no variations. a simple shop with no cart and the complicated inventory and upselling&#x2f;downwelling system.

tfl abandons plans for driverless tube trains
          
&gt; per mile basis is weird in a metro system because of distortions like how a mile in the centre is both slower and far more in demand than a mile at the edges.
what&#x27;s the problem supposed to be? passenger-miles automatically take that effect into account. they go down when speed goes down, and up when demand goes up.
&gt; both slower and far more in demand
by the way, it sounds like you think this is something strange about a metro system, but higher demand means lower speed for every form of transportation.
&gt; basically, per passenger served.
this is a mistake; the guy who crosses the whole city has gotten more value out of the metro system than the guy who goes one stop.

people care about privacy. but in our current telling its a hard problem to understand and the costs are too high. the costs are not talking to friends, or not driving a car. so as a coping mechanism people will convince themselves they dont care for privacy.
the phenomena you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t about caring.
you&#x27;re describing a &quot;trade&quot; in the same way mobsters and conmen do.

exactly. i saw a clip of an elon musk interview where he was asked if tesla would ever build a smartphone. i had to chuckle and think to myself, they already do. it just doesn&#x27;t fit in your pocket, has wheels and actually tries to kill you physically.

in praise of print: reading is essential in an era...
          
fascism is a phase under capitalism where ideology breaks down and the people in power are split between going into hiding and panicked power grabs through any means available. typically it involves ultra-nationalists taking formal political power and increasing the capitalist totalitarian impulse.
the state is much, much more &quot;all-embracing&quot; today than what mussolini could ever have imagined, and has been for a long time, decades.
musk wants a more total influence on the world, he doesn&#x27;t want anyone to be able to say something negative about him, for example. he wants to eradicate large swathes of people, explicitly by making it impossible to talk about them and in practice it will likely boil down to the destruction of their bodies once that fails.
you&#x27;re obviously sympathetic to this neo-fascist movement. let&#x27;s hope you&#x27;ll manage to leave, because by now it looks like the resistance to it has to get violent.

you could do a custom wp plugin that provides a single page with everything they need. it doesn&#x27;t have to be in the admin section, just a password-protected page. that way you stay with wp (which will likely be supported for many more years) and php (which will never, ever die) :)
